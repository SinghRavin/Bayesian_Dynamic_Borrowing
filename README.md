**Bayesian Dynamic Borrowing** <br>
This project implements the Bayesian dynamic borrowing based on the Bayesian hierarchical modeling. The project work was a part of summer internship that uses the Daiichi Sankyo Inc.'s confidential data on gastric cancer trials, hence only code is available and no data. Please reach out to me directly for any query @ ravinder.singh@utah.edu.
